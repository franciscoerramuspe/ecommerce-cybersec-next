# Gaming E-Commerce - Final Project for SE 610

This project was created by: **Francisco Erramuspe**, **Masford Boima**, and **Kiran Ramjisingh**

This project is built with the following technologies
* FrontEnd
    * React.js 
    * Next.js (dynamic pages and routing)
    * SCSS (styling)
* BackEnd
    * Strapi (Handles API and Database logic)
    * Stripe API integration to handle payment logic
* Cloud Integration (AWS)
    * S3: Storage of game info and IMGs
    * Lambda: custom processing
    * SQL Server DB hosted in AWS

The project serves as an MVP of a Gaming E-Commerce, and there are many features that can still be built/improved.

BackEnd could also be improved by rewriting it completely, but due to class time constraints (10-week period to complete whole project), we decided to use Strapi in this area.
